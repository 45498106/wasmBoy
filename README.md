# Roadmap

The project doe quality and performance also depends on the [AssemblyScript Roadmap](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/wiki/Status-and-Roadmap).

The Wasmboy library is being recorded at [Issue #3](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmBoy/issues/3)

# CLI Commands / Npm Scripts

The project contains three different elements.

* The `debugger` is the container for the wasmBoy library, which is simply a [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) application, generated with [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).
* The `wasm` which is the web assembly module for wasmBoy written in [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
* The `lib` which is the importable library of wasmBoy that can be used in other projects.

Each of these uses a different build process. The debugger uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), the wasm uses the [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiler CLI tool, and the lib uses [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en).

Commands for each part of the project will be prepended with their element name and a colon, e.g `debugger:[command here]`.

Commands not prepended with a colon are meant for easily building on all of the different parts as a whole.

``` bash
# Command to serve the project, and watch the debugger, wasm, and lib for changes
# Uses concurrently: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently
# Concurrently helps cleanup the output and organizes all three watchers/servers
npm start

# Same as npm start
npm run dev

# Same as npm start
npm run watch

# Build the wasm module and the lib to be ready to be pushed to npm or released
npm run build

# Run tests in `test/test.js`
npm run test

# Watch the debugger (preact) project for changes and livereload
npm run debugger:watch

# Build the debugger (preact) project and serve it
npm run debugger:serve

# Build the debugger (preact) project
npm run debugger:build

# Watch the wasm (AssemblyScript) *.ts files and build on changes
npm run wasm:watch

# Build the wasm (AssemblyScript) *.ts files, with the correct CLI flags
npm run wasm:build

# Watch the Wasmboy ES6 Module for changes, and build
npm run lib:watch

# Build the WasmBoy Es6 module
npm run lib:build
```

The debugger application/container for wasmBoy utilizes the [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md). Additional workflow commands and tips can be found there.

# Special Thanks

* [awesome gb-dev communitty](https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev), too many rad dudes to name!

* [dcodeIO for building and fixing bugs with AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript). And for being awesome!

* [r/emudev](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/), especially to [binjimint](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDev/comments/7y2bux/gameboy_gb_graphical_bugs_game_writes_zeroes_into/dudlj3w/) for helping me find that bug not even Blargg's cpu tests could find.

# Random Tips for new Gameboy EmuDevs:

* It's better to code an emulator by abstracting assembly commands into functions, rather than by Opcode operation

* Gameboy Opcodes are difficult till about 0x40
